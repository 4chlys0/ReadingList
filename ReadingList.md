Cyber Podcasts

------------------

//--2018--// 

*Security Now

	I prefer listening to reading news and this is a great source. Ads feel somewhat obtrusive/repetitive. Show notes provided online if one misses an episode/doesn't have two hours. 

*Security Weekly (Especially main one- also appsec weekly, sometimes business security weekly)

	Easy-to-digest even when I get tired of information security. Great format, great presenters- good balance of news, real-life examples, and humor. 

*CyberSpeak

	Very interesting interviews.  

------------------

Cyber News

------------------

//--2017--//

*Infosecindustry.com

	Aggregates infosec sources. Use this first then pick a few favorite providers. I don't read much anymore unless it's a research paper on a novel attack.

Cyber Movies/TV [Movies listed by year, TV shows by season]

------------------

//--2018--//

eXistenZ (1999)

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2016)

23 (1998)

One point o (2004)

Freedom Downtime (2001)

Swordfish (2001)

*Psycho-Pass (S1-2, 2015)

	Show with the same concept as Minority Report. 

*Serial Experiments Lain (1998)

	Great "thinking" series exploring the concept of "the wired" being a world with it's own "god". Best enjoyed on days one spends a lot of time programming/scripting.

*Zero Days (2016)

	Covers Stuxnet- not very memorable to me. Anyone a few years into infosec will probably not find this very interesting.  

*Armitage III (1995)

	Watched this because I think the Kali tool with the same name is based on this. Somewhat interesting when watched alongside Ghost in the Shell.

*Mr. Robot S1-3

	Good its technical usage of tools, may be helpful in learning. I always think of the data center scene with halon gas when reviewing CISSP material. It is great to have a visual for attacks/tools.

*Hackers (1995)

	Probably my top pick for infosec movies. Just like Mr. Robot offers a memorable visual for things one may read about like the rainbow series.

*Wargames (1983)

	Great intro movie for infosec.

*Ghost in the Shell (SAC S1/S2, 1995, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2015, 2017, 2017)

	Becomes interesting to think about after watching a few episodes of the show.

*Blackhat (2015)

	This is not worth watching.

//--2017--//

*Sneakers (1992)
	
	Great enjoyable movie, not too technical.

Cyber Books

------------------

//--2018--//

Nmap Network Scanning (Physical book not online version)

	(in progress) A must-read for anyone who uses this tool. Well-written and provides situational usage examples. It feels infinitely better to understand the functionality of all the flags than memorizing them.  

Practical Malware Analysis^

	(in progress) A great resource for getting started with Malware analysis. The field has changed, and (to mirror a podcast) things like being able to generate Yara rules are important. Still a good read. To anyone interested in learning more free malware for education/research can be found in "theZoo" on github. I made use of this resource for class projects.   

Serious Cryptography

	(in progress) A must-read for anyone interested in cryptography. Mirrored concepts I learned in a cryptography-focused graduate class very well and written concisely. I always appreciate technical material explained thoroughly yet concisely.

Black Hat Python

	(in progress) Reserving opinion until I read more thoroughly through it.

Simple CISSP (Audiobook)

	(in progress) I use this while exercising as extra security reading. It's probably better to read/annotate as a physical version since the exam is essentially memorization.

*Drive (Audiobook) [Via PSW #554 guest Masha Sedova]

	Explores Motivation/Drive. Did not agree with some of the Economics presented based on my background. I was very happy to hear a fair justification/elaboration on a few of these were later in the book. Interesting read overall. 

*Ghost in the Wire (Audiobook)

	Interesting and almost mandatory read for anyone in Information Security. 

*Reality is Broken (Audiobook) [Via PSW #554 guest Masha Sedova]

	Very good book describing a game designer's understanding of what makes games addicting (Flow/Fiero) and how to apply that to management. Gently introduces the field of positive psychology and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi which alone is worth the price.

*Beyond the Phoenix Project (Audiobook) [Via PSW podcast}

	This book goes beyond the insights of the original. Difficult to remember/learn from unless you face management problems like these regularly. Introduces a few interesting management concepts that can be read through separately. 

*Cryptography: A Short Introduction (Audiobook)

	Great book giving some history on Cryptography. Audio runs through basic mathematics/cryptography that will be hard to understand if one has not read/been taught them before.

*The Phoenix Project (Audiobook) [Via PSW podcast]

	Great book on management and IT. Particularly a good read for an academic looking to enter the workforce. Presented as a story-even if the problems faced themselves are difficult to appreciate, the characters are easy to identify with.

*The Linux Command Line

	One of the best resources on Linux for beginners. If one can read/absorb this information for sheer personal interest one will end up loving Linux.

//--2017--//

*Red Team Field Manual

	[Reference]

*Blue Team Field Manual

	[Reference]

*Automate the Boring Stuff with Python

	A great introduction to Python and displays its interesting scripting capabilities. A free book with great exercises.
