Cyber Books

Nmap Network Scanning (Physical book not online version)

	(in progress) A must-read for anyone who uses this tool. Well-written and provides situational usage examples. It feels infinitely better to understand the functionality of all the flags than memorizing them.  

Practical Malware Analysis^

	(in progress) A great resource for getting started with Malware analysis. The field has changed, and (to mirror a podcast) things like being able to generate Yara rules are important. Still a good read. To anyone interested in learning more free malware for education/research can be found in "theZoo" on github. I made use of this resource for class projects.   

Serious Cryptography

	(in progress) A must-read for anyone interested in cryptography. Mirrored concepts I learned in a cryptography-focused graduate class very well and written concisely. I always appreciate technical material explained thoroughly yet concisely.

Black Hat Python

	(in progress) Reserving opinion until I read more thoroughly through it.

Simple CISSP (Audiobook)

	(in progress) I use this while exercising as extra security reading. It's probably better to read/annotate as a physical version since the exam is essentially memorization.

*Drive (Audiobook) [Via PSW #554 guest Masha Sedova]

	Explores Motivation/Drive. Did not agree with some of the Economics presented based on my background. I was very happy to hear a fair justification/elaboration on a few of these were later in the book. Interesting read overall. 

*Ghost in the Wire (Audiobook)

	Interesting and almost mandatory read for anyone in Information Security. 

*Reality is Broken (Audiobook) [Via PSW #554 guest Masha Sedova]

	Very good book describing a game designer's understanding of what makes games addicting (Flow/Fiero) and how to apply that to management. Gently introduces the field of positive psychology and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi which alone is worth the price.

*Beyond the Phoenix Project (Audiobook) [Via PSW podcast}

	This book goes beyond the insights of the original. Difficult to remember/learn from unless you face management problems like these regularly. Introduces a few interesting management concepts that can be read through separately. 

*Cryptography: A Short Introduction (Audiobook)

	Great book giving some history on Cryptography. Audio runs through basic mathematics/cryptography that will be hard to understand if one has not read/been taught them before.

*The Phoenix Project (Audiobook) [Via PSW podcast]

	Great book on management and IT. Particularly a good read for an academic looking to enter the workforce. Presented as a story-even if the problems faced themselves are difficult to appreciate, the characters are easy to identify with.

*The Linux Command Line

	One of the best resources on Linux for beginners. If one can read/absorb this information for sheer personal interest one will end up loving Linux.

//--2017--//

*Red Team Field Manual

	[Reference]

*Blue Team Field Manual

	[Reference]

*Automate the Boring Stuff with Python

	A great introduction to Python and displays its interesting scripting capabilities. A free book with great exercises.
